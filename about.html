                        <p>Hello, my name is Ge Lyu. I am a software engineer, builder, and technical leader based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I spend my workdays designing systems, managing teams, and helping organizations grow through solutions involving artificial intelligence, big data, and full-stack development.</p>
                        <p>Outside of work, I find meaning and renewal in the wilderness. I am a fisherman, hunter, off-road driver, motorcycle rider, and a photographer with a focus on landscapes and aviation. I believe in continuous learning, independent thinking, and staying curious â€” whether through new technologies or new terrain.</p>
